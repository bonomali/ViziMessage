# Vizimessage

This app allows you to visualize some basic statistics about messages you've exchanged with contacts in your Contact book on macOS.

## The App

<img width="1312" alt="Screen Shot 2019-11-29 at 6 41 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2036040/69895531-6422c600-12e6-11ea-9093-2c5dbc898ccf.png">

Contacts from your contact book are displayed on the left-hand side, and clicking on any given contact will load their related statistics.

At present, it only takes into account what is in the messaging database on macOS, which means that it is not capable of showing statistics for messaging services other than SMS or iMessage.

## Feedback

Please open a new issue if you'd like to see a certain statistic or have another idea for how this app could be better!

## Todos

This app remains a work in progress, and as such there are some things that will be improved and updated as I work on it.

At present, these are the clear upcoming tasks:
* Memoize components to improve performance on contact view re-rendering
* Add a search bar to the contact list.
